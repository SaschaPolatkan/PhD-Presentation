            We want to prefetch (=preload) coming pages and link to different html sites. <br>
            An alternative would be to implement an observer and do lazy loading. Then on can implement an actual scroll. <br>
            Note however that for our usecase an actual scroll is probably god awful. This is better for long corpo pages that <br>
            you can scroll down on forever, having pictures load in one after another. <br>
            In our case we should fake the scroll animation by animating the outgoing page and the incoming page going upwards or <br>
            sideways when loaded/unloaded. Best however is probably just a fade-in animation, which I have already implemented on the <br> 
            page-class. Use the following code for prefetching, and see the comments in the html document:<br>
            &ltlink rel="prefetch" href="/path/to/prefetch" /&gt"
